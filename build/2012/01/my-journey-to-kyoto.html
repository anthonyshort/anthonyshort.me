      <p>Today is the second day traveling by myself in Japan and I've headed from Furano, through Sapporo and down to Kyoto. It was always going to be a bit of a character builder traveling around by myself in a country I didn't know and not being able to speak the local tongue. But next couple of days would prove to be the most interesting days yet involving tunnels, new friends and running shoe-less (and almost pants-less) through the airport.</p>

<h2>Going Underground</h2>

<p>Last time I was in Sapporo I was wandering around the city with Justin and we couldn't figure out why there were so few people on the streets in the middle of the day on a weekday. It turns out that there are tunnels that run underneath the entire CBD so you don't have to walk around in the cold!</p>

</figure></p>

<p>Up on the surface it was a zombie apocalypse-esque ghost town albeit minus the zombies (unfortunately). But I found the entrance to the tunnel. It was another world down there. There are shops, markets and cafes with literally thousands of people walking through the tunnels <strong>underground!</strong></p>

<p>For some reason the entire time I was down there I was imagining the underground music from Super Mario Bros.</p>

<p>I managed to snag this photo with this fat, cute thing. I have no idea what this is supposed to be or what they were trying to sell me so I just smiled and handed them my phone to take a photo.</p>

<h2>A Night in Susukino</h2>

<p>I stayed in a very small hostel in Sapporo called <a href="http://tpa.spirallife.jp/english/index.html">Time Peace Apartment</a>. It was run by a Japanese couple. The only other people staying there were two Korean brothers roughly my age. After a brief attempt at a  conversation we both seem to give up and close the curtains on our beds.</p>

<p>At night I explored <strong>Susukino</strong>, the trendy, restaurant and club-filled area of Sapporo. I'd had enough awkward and challenging conversations and found the closest english-speaking pub - <strong>TK6</strong>. In there I ended up talking to Jonno from Brisbane, Australia who was over here working at the university in Sapporo for a month. Seeing as it was Australia Day the bar was selling Australian beers and food. I didn't come to Japan to have Australia food, but we ended up drinking and talking all night. Good beer, good company.</p>

<p>It's amazing what little adventures you can have you when you just go looking for them.</p>

<h2>My Pants! I'm losing my pants!</h2>

<p>The next day I ended up at the airport at 9:45 when the plane was supposed to be leaving at 10:00am. I had to run with my huge bag to the check-in. After yet another difficult conversation they decided to run with me to the gate. But first I had to pass the checkpoint. They made me take of my belt, my shoes and spent the next 5 minutes searching through my bag. When that was all sorted out we had to run to the gate. I didn't have shoes on, or a belt and I had to carry my huge bag whilst running at least 100m to the gate. To top it off my pants need that belt to stay up and my hands were full so I ended up giving the people in the airport terminal a bit of a show as my pants started falling down...</p>

<p>...and the worst thing about the day is still the fact they took my shuriken at the checkpoint.</p>

<p>But at least I made it to Kyoto.</p>
