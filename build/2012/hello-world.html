      Hello World 
    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>So I&#8217;ve finally managed to put a blog together. It&#8217;s only taken 5 years, dozens of design iterations and now finally I think I have something I can work with. I&#8217;m headed to Japan in a couple of days and decided that this was definitely something I wanted to record somehow. I couldn&#8217;t let this opportunity go to waste.</p>

<p>So I put my mind to it and put this site together in probably 3 hours from start to finish. No Photoshop, just plain HTML. I didn&#8217;t use Sass or Coffeescript. I didn&#8217;t think about design. I just wanted something that would let me write down my thoughts and post funny cat pictures.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really sick of designs that include icons everywhere. Fancy javascript widgets. Sidebars with links all over the place. People come to blogs to read. That&#8217;s what we should be giving them. I think I&#8217;ve done a bit better in that regard. One thing I am realising as I&#8217;m putting together this quick first blog post is that I definitely need to practice writing more often. Hopefully writing on this blog every week will turn my caveman ranting into intellectual observations about life and the web industry.</p>

<p>Or maybe it will just end up being photos of cats.</p>
