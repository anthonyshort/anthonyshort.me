Today I'm headed to Japan for the very first time. It has been a long time coming. I've been in love with Japanese culture for years and now I'm headed to Sapporo, Hokkaido for some backpacking and snow boarding adventures. I'll be traveling around the country by myself for the next 3 weeks.

I was determined to not be an ignorant western tourist when I came to Japan but I never really got around to learning Japanese. I had a moment of realisation the first time I tried to talk to someone, a girl at a ticket counter in the train station, and I stood there realising I had no idea what to say and fell back onto "do you speak english?" without even so much as a hello in Japanese. I've become that tourist. Most people in Japanese are very polite to you as long as you make the effort to at least say, "hello, sorry do you speak english?" in Japanese. As long as you try just a little bit most people are willing to help you out.
