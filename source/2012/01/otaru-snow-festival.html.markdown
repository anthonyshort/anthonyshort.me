title: Otaru Snow Festival
date: 2012/02/05
---

Over the past week I've been traveling around Hokkaido a fair bit. The novelty the snow once offered is now all but gone. Nothing particularly interesting has happened over the past week apart from a bit of sightseeing, more interesting food and more snow-covered everything. The Otaru Snow Festival was the exception. The festival had amazing food, warm cherry beer and beautiful scenery. It was one of the best days I've had in Japan.

After leaving Kyoto the first place I ventured to was Jozenkei. It's a small onsen town about hour west of Sapporo. I spent the night in a fancy, traditional hotel there and just relaxed for a while. Everything about this place made me feel out of place. It was clearly for rich, japanese people not backpacking Australians. But I was able to experience a traditional Japanese-style room with tatami mats, floor table (seems an appropriate name seeing as you sit on the floor to use it) and decor.

The really interesting part of this stay was the meal. Dinner was a 10-course meal of food I'd mostly never eaten before. In the restaurant and I had my own private cubicle in a tatami mat room with a floor table. Most of the food was decent. I even had to cook my own chicken in a pot of miso in the middle of the table. One of the fish meals looked suspiciously like chicken. I asked the waitress (who was a giant she-man of questionable gender who had been giving me giggling looks all night because I was a foreigner) but she didn't speak a word of English so I was left questioning the mystery meat. I thought it best to put that one aside just in case I was supposed to cook it as well but I had a little taste first.

Unfortunately the town had been hit hard with snow fall the night I arrived and all of the tourist attractions of the area were completely inaccessible. The towns 'mascot' is the kappa. Which I'm assuming from all the statues everywhere is a turtle. All of the baths scattered around town had kappa statues and there were bigger kappa statues on the bridges. They remind me of Koopa Troopers. Everything about Japan is just so wacky and cutesy.

The next day I set off for Niseko. Most people travel to Niseko for snowboarding. I, however, went there just for the atmosphere. I'd heard that the town was overrun with Australians. The tales were true. Every store had English menus, the people who worked there spoke English and every person you bumped into on the street was an Australian. I became blisteringly aware of the rudeness of Australians during my stay in Niseko. Compared to the Japanese they are loud, foul-mouthed and arrogant. Maybe just the fact that the Japanese are so polite and friendly made it more obvious but I felt embarrassed to be Australian while I was there.

I spent two days in Niseko exploring the town by day and night. The highlight of the trip was definitely the hostel I stayed in. On the second night, me and Ryo, the hostel owner, stayed up late drinking a lot of sake from the sake factory next door and sharing stories. Another friend of Ryo's was there with us but she didn't speak English so every sentence needed to be translated back and forth by Ryo. It was easily the best and most friendly hostel I've ever stayed in. He even gave all the guests lifts to where ever they wanted to go and cleaned the house from top to bottom every single day.

After Niseko I traveled back to Sapporo. I had planned to see the Otaru and Sapporo Snow Festivals while in town. On Saturday Jono, Maria and myself caught the train to Otaru to see the snow festival being held there. The town was beautiful and a distinct European and American influence was noticeable in it's architecture. It was actually quite weird. Otaru is primarily a fishing and tourist village and they didn't disappoint with the food. There were lots of little shops selling seafood. Giant crabs, oysters and clams were sitting in tanks waiting to be cooked up for the people passing by the store. The whole town had the smell of the ocean wafting through it that reminded me very much of home.

Down near the canal we found the Otaru Beer Factory by accident. Inside was a large dining hall that you would expect to be in a European town. High roof, constructed from wood and with two giant brew devices in the centre of the room that are used to brew the local Otaru beer. During winter they sell hot cherry beer, hot honey beer and hot smokey beer. The cherry beer was delicious and warmed you from the inside. It help counteract the effects of the snow and freezing cold outside. It almost tasted like mulled wine. The honey beer had a very distinct taste of honey but was less sweet and the beer taste was much more noticeable. Cherry beer seems to be their signature drink at the snow festivals in Hokkaido.

By the time we had finished eating, darkness and snow had started falling so we made our way outside. The ocean winds put a sharp edge on the cold that cut straight through you. It was only -4ยบ but the wind made it seem much, much colder. We walked down the main shopping area of Otaru and went into every shop just to get away from the cold. There were some amazing shops down that street. They primarily sold leather and glass goods but they handcraft everything they make. One of the leather stores had some very complex bags and models made entirely from leather. I haven't seen anything like that before. There were a lot of glass shops as this area was very famous for it's glass-making in the past.

The town is also known for music boxes. We found a shop full of hand-made music boxes. Some of them were elaborately-carved wood and others were made from glass. They had a table full of pop music in the form of music boxes, most of which we had never heard of before as it was all japanese and korean pop music. But there were some gems in there, namely the Star Wars and Darth Vader music boxes. They would have made a great gift but the novelty of the music boxes fades fairly quickly. By the time we had tried out most of them once we were sick of them.

The town had had one more surprise though. Pet algae balls. I kid you not. They are balls of algae that are only found in a few places on Earth. One of those places happens to be this town. You can buy them in various sizes and the water needs to be changed weekly. It's probably only one step up from a pet rock.

We walked back to the canal and the festival had started. The canal was filled with candles floating in the icy water. On the walkway there were snow and ice sculptures. There were stalls where they were selling warm cherry beer, seafood soup and tasty, local crab. There were candles lit everywhere and a big love heart made from snow and candles where couples could get a photo taken. Every sculpture had candles and the canal was full of them. It was really beautiful but the cold was making the whole thing very unpleasant. A couple of cups of hot cherry beer and we were good to go!

There were small houses, little caves filled with candles, little fortresses and towns, small snowmen with anime-style faces on them, little igloos filled with candles for kids, a miniature house, tunnels and brilliantly lit pathways. The light from a thousand candles lit the canal and the walkway with light bouncing off water and ice creating spectacular colours.

Unfortunately the iPhone's camera really struggles to take decent photos in low-light so most of the photos I took are very grainy. They look too awful to really post up here. Next time I come to Japan I'll bring my DSLR so that I can get some really great pictures.

I'm coming back to Otaru in the next few days so I'll have a better chance to explore the town and try out their food. I think the snow festival is on for a week so I'll have plenty of time to drink lots of cherry beer.
