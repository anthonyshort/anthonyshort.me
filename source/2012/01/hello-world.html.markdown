So I've finally managed to put a blog together. It's only taken 5 years, dozens of design iterations and now finally I think I have something I can work with. I'm headed to Japan in a couple of days and decided that this was definitely something I wanted to record somehow. I couldn't let this opportunity go to waste. 

So I put my mind to it and put this site together in probably 3 hours from start to finish. No Photoshop, just plain HTML. I didn't use Sass or Coffeescript. I didn't think about design. I just wanted something that would let me write down my thoughts and post funny cat pictures.

I'm really sick of designs that include icons everywhere. Fancy javascript widgets. Sidebars with links all over the place. People come to blogs to read. That's what we should be giving them. I think I've done a bit better in that regard. One thing I am realising as I'm putting together this quick first blog post is that I definitely need to practice writing more often. Hopefully writing on this blog every week will turn my caveman ranting into intellectual observations about life and the web industry. 

Or maybe it will just end up being photos of cats.
