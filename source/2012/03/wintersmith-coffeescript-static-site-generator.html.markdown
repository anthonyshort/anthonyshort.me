title: Wintersmith - The Cool Coffeescript Static Site Generator
date: 2012/03/27

Last week I discovered another static site generator, [Wintersmith](http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/), that is built on top of node. It looks extreming promising and I do love a good static site generator. My site is built on [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) which is a ruby-based static site generator. I'm considering switching to Wintersmith simply because I can extend it with Coffeescript. As a newly christened Coffeescript fanboy I'm taking any chance I get to use the language. It won't compile the Sass for me automatically but this is something I can live without.

If you haven't considered using a static site generator for your personal blog or small site then I highly recommend it. I'll never go back to a CMS for small sites. Ever.
