I've been using Sass now for the past few years and, dare I say it, before it was cool. I've used it on nearly every site I've built since then so I've had a fair bit of time to develop some habits. I thought I'd say some of my personal code style conventions. We've been using this with the team at Newism for a while now and it works fairly well.
