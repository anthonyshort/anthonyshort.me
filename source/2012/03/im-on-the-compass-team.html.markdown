I'm proud to announce that I'm now a part of the [Compass](http://compass-style.org) core team! I'm joining a host of amazing developers. Compass 0.12 just landed and we have big plans for 0.13. I'm looking forward to the pure awesomeness we are going to create and I'm honoured to be part of the team.
